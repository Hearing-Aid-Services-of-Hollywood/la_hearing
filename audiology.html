        <h4>Diagnostic Audiological Evaluation</h4>
        <p>A Diagnostic Audiological Evaluation consists of hearing threshold and speech testing performed in a sound-treated room to assess whether a hearing loss is medically treatable. The testing measures the degree and defines the type of loss. Advanced procedures are performed to determine the patientâ€™s comfortable and uncomfortable listening levels. This assures proper selection and adjustment of hearing aids.</p>
        <h4>Tympanometry/Impedance Testing</h4>
        <p>Tympanometry/Impedance Testing diagnoses conditions of fluid accumulation, perforated eardrum, Eustachian tube dysfunction and other middle ear problems. These conditions might require medical intervention prior to fitting hearing aids.</p>
        <h4>Neuro-diagnostic Testing</h4>
        <p>Neuro-diagnostic Testing includes a variety of specialized tests to assist physicians in evaluating dizziness, imbalance, tinnitus (head noises), acoustic tumors and other neurological disorders.</p>
