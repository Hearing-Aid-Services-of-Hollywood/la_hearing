			<h3>Your FREE Solution to Better Hearing on the Telephone</h3>
			<img src="{{'assets/images/caption-call-2016.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail d-block mx-auto">
			<p>CaptionCall® is your no-cost solution for improved communication on the telephone. The device operation is similar to captioning on TV. It uses advanced technology to display voice-to-text content nearly instantly. Captions are available in both English and Spanish.</p>
			<p>CaptionCall is exclusively available to individuals with hearing losses. The company is an authorized captioning telephone service provider and receives its compensation from a fund administered by the Federal Communications Commission. The phone is delivered and installed by a CaptionCall representative at no charge. You must maintain a landline, but there are no monthly service charges for CaptionCall.</p>
			<h3>How Caption Call Works</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>The CaptionCall user hears the caller's voice over a standard phone line.</li>
				<li>The voice of the caller is sent to the CaptionCall service via an Internet connection.</li>
				<li>The caller's words are quickly converted to text using voice-recognition technology.</li>
				<li>Captions are sent back to the CaptionCall phone's display screen.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>CaptionCall service is also available through a mobile app for the Apple® iPad®. CaptionCall Mobile enables you to receive calls on your iPad anywhere with an Internet or mobile connection. The app can be downloaded from the Apple App Store.</p>
			<p>To receive a free CaptionCall phone or the iPad app, contact my office. I will gladly complete and submit a professional certification form on your behalf.</p>
