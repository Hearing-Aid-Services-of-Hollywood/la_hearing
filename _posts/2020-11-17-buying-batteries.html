	<p class="mb-4 mt-4 font-italic text-secondary">Imagine this scenario: Mr. Watson arrives at our office with the complaint that there is something wrong with his new hearing aids. He claims that he is not hearing as well with the high-end digital instruments he purchased six months ago. We ask to examine them and notice that they have been well maintained. Jeff then listens to the hearing aids and notices that both appear to have lost some of their fidelity. Yet, the microphones and loudspeaker systems are unobstructed and clean.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>After opening the battery compartments, he finds that each instrument is fitted with a discount-priced battery that Mr. Watson obtained from a big-box warehouse store. The battery tester shows that both batteries have the proper voltage of 1.4 volts. What could be the problem? Are these defective hearing aids? Did Mr. Watson waste his money?</p>
	<p>Jeff calmly opens a new package of Rayovac Ultra Proline batteries and place one into each of the instruments. After Mr. Watson inserts the devices into his ears, Jeff asks him, “How do they sound now?” His response: “They sound wonderful! What’s going on?” Jeff replies: “The explanation is really quite elementary, my dear Watson.”</p>
	<p>The moral of this tale is that you should use the best power source available to you to maximize the benefit you receive from your hearing instruments. The little extra you spend will yield a big return. If you can’t come into the office for batteries, simply call us, and we’ll promptly mail the appropriate batteries to you. Mr. Watson left our office with a new outlook on batteries and a package of Rayovac Ultra Proline cells tucked into his coat pocket. Another mystery solved.</p>
