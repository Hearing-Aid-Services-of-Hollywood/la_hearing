	        <h4 class="modal-title">Oticon’s New Opn S: A Step Closer to Normal Hearing.</h4>
	      </div>
	      <div class="modal-body">
		  	<p>The biggest challenge for people with hearing loss is understanding speech of multiple speakers when in noisy environments. Oticon answered that challenge with the advent of the Opn product line in 2016. Yet, in only three years of development, Oticon has taken a great product and made it even more impressive. The just released Oticon Opn S™ delivers markedly improved performance and greater convenience than the previous generation of Opn devices.</p>
			<p>The Opn S has the fastest, most advanced circuitry available in the hearing aid world. The new Velox S platform chip can monitor changes in the acoustic environment by making an astounding 56,000 measurements per second. The Opn S micro-computer continually accesses and analyzes all of the speech information in the listener’s surroundings. The system works so rapidly that it can reduce unwanted noise, even between words. The levels of noise coming from all directions are instantly reduced, while the speech signals are simultaneously preserved.</p>
			<p>OpenSound Optimizer technology is a breakthrough in sound quality and speech understanding, providing up to 30 percent more speech cues than previous Opn models. This feature allows the user to decide who and what to listen to and to switch attention as desired, no matter where the speaker is positioned. The result is superior understanding of multiple voices in all listening situations while significantly reducing listening effort. Oticon’s studies have shown that Opn S users experience speech understanding in difficult listening environments equal to the performance of people with normal hearing. Additionally, in a study of current Opn users, 96 percent preferred the Opn S to their own Opn instruments, and they made the choice to upgrade.</p>
			<h4>Easy wireless connections and the option of hassle-free rechargeability</h4>
			<p>Opn S connects directly to your iPhone® so you can seamlessly converse on your phone, listen to podcasts or stream music. The optional TV adapter turns your hearing aids into a wireless headset. You will hear TV audio in high-fidelity stereo while others in the room listen at their preferred volume level.</p>
			<p>If you’re looking for added convenience, you can choose the Opn S rechargeable solution. An overnight battery charge lets you power up state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries for a full day of uninterrupted listening... no more batteries to buy or to search for and insert while in the midst of an important conversation.</p>
			<p>Never before could a manufacturer or an audiologist claim that a device offered hearing improvement that compared favorably to normal hearing, but Opn S breaks the limits of what we thought was possible with hearing aids. Proven to provide even better speech understanding with less effort in noisy environments than the previous generation of hearing aids, Opn S lets you take an active part in difficult listening situations, just as those with normal hearing do.</p>
			<p>I encourage you to set up a time to come in and experience this extraordinary new hearing instrument from Oticon.</p>

		  	<p class="lead">ReSound manufactures premier high-power hearing instruments for those with severe to profound hearing impairments.</p>
			<h4>Brilliant Sound Experience</h4>
			<p>With a high input dynamic range and an extended frequency bandwidth, the crystal-clear sound of Quattro is distortion free, allowing you to distinguish between slight sound variations in all listening environments. Quattro also provides a rich and detailed streaming experience for phone calls, music or TV.</p>
			<h4>Directional Technology</h4>
			<p>Binaural Directionality III is the latest advancement to help you hear speech in noisy environments. This feature uses ear-to-ear coupling which balances sounds in front, to the sides and from the back, creating a more natural listening experience.</p>
			<h4>Advanced Rechargeable Solution</h4>
			<p>Quattro’s advanced rechargeable system is available with most models. The lithium-ion battery provides up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. In addition, the base of the portable charging unit holds three full charges, so you can recharge your hearing aids for three days without coupling to a power outlet.</p>
