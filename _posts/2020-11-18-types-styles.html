				<h2>Hearing Instruments</h2>
				<p>We strive to ensure that our patients achieve a better quality of life through improved hearing. At our facility, all leading brands of hearing aids are available in every style and size, including the latest digital and completely-in-the-canal hearing aids. We carry Widex, Phonak, Oticon, GN ReSound and Siemens premium hearing instruments. A complete selection of budget-friendly digital models is also available.</p>
				<p>After a thorough hearing evaluation, an individual treatment plan is developed to address each patient’s unique hearing loss, lifestyle and preferences. We prescribe specific makes, models and special circuits to maximize hearing capabilities. Our comprehensive programs include extensive follow-up, counseling, testing and on-site servicing.</p>

				<h2>Power Products For Severe to Profound Hearing Loss</h2>
				<p>For those of you with severe to profound hearing losses there are two products that will make a significant improvement in your ability to understand speech in all listening situations.</p>
				<p>The Oticon Chili V, VII and IX are based on the RISE 2 microchip. These products work in tandem to automatically locate speech using directional microphones. Speech Guard and noise reduction technologies enhance the speech while decreasing interfering noise.</p>
				<p>Phonak’s Naida S III, V and IX are based on the second generation Spice microchip and feature SoundRecover. SoundRecover is a process that moves sounds from high-frequency areas that you can no longer hear to lower frequency bands that you can hear. Studies have shown that, over time, the brain reinterprets the modified information, increasing speech understanding.</p>
