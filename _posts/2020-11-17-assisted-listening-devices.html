	<h4>Assistive listening devices (ALDs) are available to augment the performance of your hearing aids.</h4>
	<p>These devices generally fall into the following categories:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Personal face-to-face communication</li>
		<li>Telephone communication</li>
		<li>Listening and signaling devices for the home environment</li>
	</ul>
	<p>ALDs help reduce the limits that distance, background noise, reverberation and distortion can cause by bringing sound directly from its source into your hearing aids or ears. This is done by connecting your hearing aids to the sound source using an FM or infrared device using blue tooth or induction loop technologies.</p>
	<p>Better telephone communication can be achieved by using amplified telephones or captioning phones. Multi-tone ringers, flashing lights and vibrating devices can assist in alerting you to incoming phone calls, doorbells, fire alarms, a crying baby or the speech of somebody in an adjacent room. These same devices can be coupled to a special clock for wake-up alarms or time reminders.</p>
	<p>A wide variety of ALDs is offered through our office. Some can be obtained for no charge through government agencies. Ask us for details.</p>
