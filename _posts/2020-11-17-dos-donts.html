	<h3><strong>Don'ts</strong></h3>
	<ul class="donts">
		<li><strong>DON'T</strong> ever remove your hearing aids in a bathroom.</li>
		<li><strong>DON'T</strong> get them wet. If you do, pat them dry, remove the batteries and call me immediately.</li>
		<li><strong>DON'T</strong> sleep with your hearing aids. You may break or lose them.</li>
		<li><strong>DON'T</strong> buy bargain batteries. Your hearing aids won’t perform as well.</li>
		<li><strong>DON'T</strong> wear your spouse’s hearing aids. They won’t fit properly and are not adjusted for your hearing loss.</li>
		<li><strong>DON'T</strong> store your batteries in a refrigerator.</li>
	</ul>
